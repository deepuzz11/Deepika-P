### Hi there 👋 I'm Deepika P, and it's a pleasure to virtually meet you. While it might seem unconventional to draft a README about oneself, akin to the documentation reserved for software, I believe it's a unique opportunity to offer you a glimpse into who I am. So, without further ado, allow me to introduce myself.
